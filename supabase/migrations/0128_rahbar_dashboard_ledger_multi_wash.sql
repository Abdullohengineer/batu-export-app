-- Multi-wash support: rahbar_dashboard_ledger. Depends on 0124/0125/0127.
-- docs/decisions/0191.
--
-- Same client_lines/client_washes-style split as get_client_report (0127):
-- `lines` stays per-serial (raw material movement, reconciliation
-- identity). New `washes` CTE, one row per (serial, wash_no), takes over
-- moyka_in_process/moyka_opening_total (open wash only) and
-- processed_lines (Ledger B's own realized-processed figure).
--
-- One genuine difference from get_client_report: this function's own
-- "processed in period" trigger is Basis B (its 2026-08-30/08-31 fixes,
-- preserved here) -- "did this wash RETURN OUTPUT in the period," not
-- "did this wash CLOSE in the period" -- plus a snapshot subtraction of
-- whatever's still unreturned in an open wash as of p_to. That snapshot
-- is exactly kirim_line_moyka_asof(serial, p_to) (0125), reused directly
-- rather than re-derived.
--
-- Same documented simplification as get_client_report (0127): a wash's
-- own sent_capped_kg is still capped against the SERIAL's lifetime
-- effective_qty (not a per-wash share of it) -- the same rare compound
-- edge case (multi-wash + over-declared-qty + washes landing in
-- different periods), same reasoning, not re-litigated here.
